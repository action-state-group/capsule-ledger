"""Two-arm packaging switch: which surfaces this install shows.

One wheel, one codebase, two arms -- never a fork. ``guards-only`` keeps the
caps/dedupe/verify-before-dispatch checks and ``dry_run`` fully functional;
the evidence machinery underneath (capsules, permalinks, verify surfaces)
stays present in the code but is not surfaced: no capsule vocabulary in CLI
output, no share/verify links printed or rendered, and the record-query verbs
(``log``/``show``/``verify``/``bundle``) are not registered at all. ``full``
is today's existing behavior, unchanged.

Mechanism, and why: an environment variable rather than a pip extra, a
persistent config file, or a per-invocation CLI flag.

* A pip extra (``asg-ledger[evidence]``) implies a *dependency* difference --
  something extra gets installed. Nothing does: both arms import the exact
  same modules, the only difference is what's registered/rendered. An extra
  would misdescribe what actually changed.
* A per-invocation flag (``--minimal``/``--full``) has to be remembered on
  every command, which is exactly the kind of friction that would confound
  the very activation/enforcement metrics this packaging split exists to
  measure honestly.
* A persistent config file needs an init step before first use, which adds
  friction to the "clean install" acceptance test this task is measured
  against.
* An env var can be set once (in the environment an operator already
  controls for their agent runtime) and then every ``asg`` invocation in
  that environment picks it up consistently, with zero extra state and zero
  per-command overhead.
