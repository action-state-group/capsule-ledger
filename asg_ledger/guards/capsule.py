"""Build and seal a guard decision as an Agent Action Capsule.

A decision capsule never asserts that the underlying action executed --
that is the downstream dispatcher's own capsule to emit, not this one's.
Per the -02 disposition spec (§ Disposition and the verdict reason-class):
``verdict_class`` is "legitimately absent for a clean executed verdict", so
``allow`` leaves it absent rather than claiming ``executed`` for something
this capsule did not itself do. ``deny`` uses the registry-seeded ``blocked``
token. ``escalate`` uses ``hitl_dispatched`` (D1, 2026-08-05, ledger-lane
outbox): the guard is the one routing the action to a human who has not yet
acted, which is what -02 §verdictclass defines ``hitl_dispatched`` as
("routed to a human operator; awaiting resolution") -- ``deferred`` is a
*human*-elected postponement, a different, later state. ``disposition.decision``
also takes ``hitl_dispatched`` under the same decision; it sits outside the
seeded ``accept``/``reject``/``needs_input``/``deferred`` set, but an
unregistered ``decision`` value is informational to a verifier, never a
rejection, per -02's conformance rules (see STATUS.md's Needs decision
section for the still-open ``supersedes`` vs. requested-but-unregistered
``resolves`` relation question -- unrelated to D1, not resolved here).

Money amounts have no field in the core -02 schema. ``asg_payload`` is a
single namespaced, non-spec payload extension (never a repurposed spec-
defined field, per the workspace's extension-field rule) carrying the one
numeric field the fold engine needs (``amount_minor``, integer minor units
-- floats are a fold determinism MUST-FAIL). It is committed into
``capsule_id`` like every other payload field, so it can't be tampered with
post-seal without invalidating the digest.
