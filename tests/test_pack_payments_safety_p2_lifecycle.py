"""payments-safety pack, P2 acceptance: the full lifecycle the starter-packs
plan describes --

    capsule init --pack payments-safety      (observe: records, no enforcement)
    capsule thresholds propose                (fold observed traffic -> a proposal)
    capsule guard dry-run --proposals          (report: what would ALSO be held)
    capsule enforce --pack payments-safety    (human accepts -> observe -> enforce)

-- run end to end against real traffic, not mocked at any step: install in
observe mode, submit real decisions (dry_run=True, recorded but never
blocking), fold a proposer over that recorded traffic, build a report
showing the proposed-cap delta, accept the proposal, and confirm the SAME
kind of traffic now genuinely escalates (dry_run=False) under the accepted
cap -- the plan's own acceptance bar: "same traffic now actually denies/
escalates, records chain correctly."
