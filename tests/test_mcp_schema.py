"""Tool-schema snapshot test: pins the exact name/description/inputSchema of
every MCP tool this server exposes, so a future accidental signature change
(a renamed field, a dropped default, a parameter silently added or removed)
is caught by a diff against `tests/fixtures/mcp_tool_schema_snapshot.json`
rather than discovered by a caller at runtime.

Importing `asg_ledger.mcp.server` and listing its tools requires no ledger
config -- tool registration is pure metadata; nothing here opens a ledger.
