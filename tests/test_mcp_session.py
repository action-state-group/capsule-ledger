"""A scripted Claude/Goose-style session: a fixture, not a live call, but every
question below goes through the real FastMCP server object end-to-end
(`mcp.call_tool`, the same dispatch path a real MCP host uses) -- proving each
answer carries real verification data, not just plausible-looking prose a
mocked tool could equally well have returned.

Note: `outcome` ("allow"/"deny"/"escalate") is the guard engine's own stable
vocabulary (`guards/capsule.py`'s `ALLOW`/`DENY`/`ESCALATE`) and is asserted on
directly below. `disposition.decision`/`verdict_class` are a separate,
in-flux vocabulary (see the workspace's `ldg-verdict-vocab` track) -- this
file deliberately asserts only that they are *present*, never their literal
value, so it stays correct regardless of which token set lands.
