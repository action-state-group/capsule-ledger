# -- lock-independence under GENUINE concurrent ledger mutation ------------
#
# ``tests/test_plan_containment_check.py`` proves the check is structurally
# incapable of a ledger read (signature has no ledger param) and is a pure
# function called repeatedly with no ledger in scope. Neither test actually
# races a live mutation against the check while it runs -- the property this
# item requires ("assert containment's verdict is unchanged under concurrent
# ledger mutation. This is the property that lets it enforce ahead of the
# caps work; if it is not tested it is not a property, it is a hope").
# ``[ldg-guardengine-caps-race]`` proved ``caps`` unsafe this exact way: two
# concurrent ``GuardEngine.check()`` calls sharing one ledger, racing a
# read-decide-append window (``tests/test_pack_differential_concurrency.py``).
# This test races the SAME shape of concurrent writers against the SAME
# shared store and engine, with a plan bound, and asserts every single
# plan_containment verdict -- in-plan and departure alike -- comes back
# exactly as an isolated, sequential call would, on every one of many
# interleavings. Unlike ``caps``, there is nothing to find: the check never
# reads the store the noise writers are mutating.
