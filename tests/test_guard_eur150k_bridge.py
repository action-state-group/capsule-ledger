"""The EUR150k bridge scenario: the real amaury sample ledger, capsule
cd0692b3 (a transfer_funds/€150,000 attempt already recorded as `blocked`
by a prior, independent policy engine). This guard, given the same action
fresh, independently re-evaluates it on its own caps evidence and -- per D2
(2026-08-05) -- escalates rather than blocks: `money.transfer` has an
`approver_role` configured (matching the HITL Bridge design's dev/GC
screens, real capsule cd0692b3, checkpoint #217), so a pure cap-exceeded
hold routes to a human (`hitl_dispatched`) instead of an automatic deny. The
new `hitl_dispatched` capsule still closes the stale `blocked` item with a
`supersedes`-chained decision capsule: the registry's own definition of
`supersedes` -- "Terminal transition over the parent -- resolution, expiry,
escalation close/replace the parent's open state" -- covers an escalation
closing/replacing a parent's open state, not only a terminal resolution.
`blocked` is a formal open-item verdict_class per the -02 spec's open-items
predicate; `hitl_dispatched` is itself an open item too, closed only by a
later, human-signed decision capsule (also `supersedes`-chained) that this
v0 does not yet build -- that's the HITL Bridge design's actual close, not
this test's scope.

`relation: resolves`, named in the T3 kickoff's acceptance text, still does
not exist in the chain.relation registry (only `confirms`, `supersedes`,
`epoch_opens`); `supersedes` remains the token used here -- see STATUS.md's
Needs decision (unrelated to D1/D2, not resolved by this task).
