"""P1 acceptance: the refusal set demonstrated on BOTH partner shapes, and
tau2-bench-retail-shaped traces expressing both format gaps.

Three committed, synthetic, neutrally-named fixture packs under
``tests/fixtures/packs/``:

- ``causal_remediation_shaped`` -- the shape where the agent CAN act
  directly (design §1: "agent authority | acts -- changes state directly").
- ``advisory_incident_shaped`` -- the shape where the agent CANNOT act at
  all, read-only advisory (design §1: "agent authority | cannot act").
- ``retail_synthetic_shaped`` -- hand-built, retail-domain-shaped (refund /
  exchange tool families), NOT a generated tau2-bench shift; see the
  fixture's own header comment and the ``[ldg-cs-p1-schema]`` outbox report
  for why (Track C has not produced a real corpus yet).

A single-shape fixture set would not discharge this acceptance line --
the undecomposed-trust claim (``agent.caused_resolution``) must be shown
refusing under each shape independently.
