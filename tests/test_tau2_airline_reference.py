"""Tests for the tau2-airline offline reference (P6b acceptance bar):
a stranger with the repo and no network sees real refusals, a real
WITH-INSTRUMENTATION item, and can verify one row offline.

Four concerns:
1. Every vendored dataset replays to real, known guard verdicts -- not
   "the script didn't crash." Counts below are a regression pin against
   the vendored data; if the vendored files or the predicates change,
   these numbers must be re-derived, not adjusted to make the test pass.
2. At least two real refusals and at least one real WITH-INSTRUMENTATION
   item exist -- the P6b acceptance line, checked mechanically.
3. The exported fixture is a real, independently offline-verifiable
   ledger (queue-protocol.md §7's "every check must fail its mutant":
   test_capsule_verify_offline_for_a_denied_call would fail if the
   ledger/signature machinery were broken).
4. The basic-economy predicate is load-bearing: neutering it collapses
   the update_reservation_flights refusal count to zero, proving this
   reference's refusals come from the predicate actually running, not
   from some other path.
