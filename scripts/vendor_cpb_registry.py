"""Re-vendor the CPB registry snapshot from a local scitt-payload-binding checkout.

The machine-readable CPB registry of record is
``action-state-group/scitt-payload-binding/registry.json`` (live tables) plus
``spec/cpb-provisional-registry.md`` (the Rung-3 provisional entries). It is
meant to be *vendored* into consuming packages as a local, no-network snapshot
so a viewer/verifier can resolve a payload class's status offline. This mirrors
the existing ``scripts/vendor_bundle_viewer.py`` pattern: one generated artifact
is copied in by hand, re-run when the upstream changes, and the exact upstream
commit is recorded for provenance.

capsule-ledger already vendors ``capsule_ledger/registry/conventions.json``
(action-class labels). This script adds the CPB registry alongside it:

* ``capsule_ledger/registry/cpb_registry.json`` — the live-table
  ``registry.json`` verbatim, with a provenance envelope (pinned commit).
* the ``provisional_field_conventions`` block inside ``conventions.json`` — the
  human labels for the AAC six-registry field values that vendored *provisional*
  payload classes (e.g. ``mesh-inference-exchange``) set on the surrounding
  capsule. capsule-ledger's own verify path delegates to
  ``agent_action_capsule.verify``, which resolves those values as
  known-provisional against its own vendored CPB snapshot; this file carries the
  *display* labels for the same values so ledger surfaces render them
  consistently.

The field-value → payload-class binding is hand-curated from the producer named
in the CPB entry's Reference (``action-state-group/capsule-emit-mesh``) and is
NOT fabricated into the CPB registry itself — the CPB markdown stays normative.

Usage:
    python scripts/vendor_cpb_registry.py [path-to-scitt-payload-binding-checkout]

If no path is given, tries ``$SCITT_PAYLOAD_BINDING_PATH``, else a sibling
checkout at ``../scitt-payload-binding`` next to this repo.
