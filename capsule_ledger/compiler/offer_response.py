"""Offer/response recording -- the denominator primitive (design §4b gap 2).

*An offer was made; a response occurred; the response is recorded whether
or not it was the desired one.* One deployment's negative case is a
decline from a person offered a choice; another's is an operator who read
a recommendation and did something else instead. Same primitive underneath
both, which is exactly why it is named ``offer``/``response``/
``response_class`` here and not ``consent`` -- that word imports one
deployment's domain vocabulary into the shared format, precisely what the
admission rule (design §1: "nothing enters the format on one deployment's
evidence alone") forbids.

Two passive ``fyi`` records, same mechanism ``conversation/capsules.py``
uses: an offer capsule (what was proposed, and to whom) and a response
capsule chained to it (what happened). The response is REQUIRED to exist
for every offer, even when ``response_class="no_response"`` -- an offer
with no matching response capsule is a missing record, not a "no response"
one; recording "nothing happened by <as-of time>" is itself an act, because
without it the positive case (``accepted``) has no denominator.

**The option set (design/agent-human-engagement §3.1, §5b).** The offer
capsule alone used to carry only ``offer_digest`` -- a verifier could not
tell *"here are three options, pick one"* apart from *"click OK to
proceed."* This is a FORMAT change, not a pack field: it is justified on
both partners it was checked against (an engineer who acted on the one
thing an agent proposed and an engineer who chose one of three are not
making the same act), never on the single-partner "no denominator"
argument alone, which the admission rule rejects by itself. ``option_digests``
records one digest per option offered; ``option_count`` is that list's own
length, carried explicitly on the capsule so a verifier reads it off the
record rather than recomputing it. A response may name
``selected_option_digest`` -- which of the offer's own options was taken --
and the guard below refuses to let that claim stand against an offer that
only ever had one option: a choice claim is enforceable at act time, not
merely reportable.
