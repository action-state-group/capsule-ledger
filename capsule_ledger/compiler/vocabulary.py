"""Closed vocabulary for the outcome compiler, and its display strings.

Five closed sets, each shipping its plain-language rendering in this same
module (design §3.6: "an enum without a display string is developer
vocabulary leaking onto the auditor's desk"):

- ``FORWARD_VERDICTS`` / ``BACKWARD_VERDICTS`` -- the verdict PAIR every
  compiled statement carries (design §2.2). This is a schema *shape*
  decision: two enums per statement, not one annotation. The judge is never
  in the enforcement path, so ``MODEL-ASSISTED`` is a backward-only value --
  it has no forward counterpart.
- ``RESPONSE_CLASSES`` -- the offer/response denominator primitive (design
  §4b gap 2): an offer was made, a response occurred, and the response is
  recorded whether or not it was the one wanted. Named ``response_class``,
  never ``consent`` -- that word imports one partner's domain vocabulary
  into a shared format.
- ``REFUSAL_REASON_CODES`` -- v0, closed, extended deliberately (same
  "unregistered is a typo" doctrine as ``packs/schema.py``'s other closed
  sets). Seeded with exactly the two refusals this wave's design work
  demonstrated: an effect claim that assumes the agent caused a resolution
  it can only be shown to have recommended, and a goal too unbounded to
  decompose into windowed proxies. Deliberately extended once more
  ([ldg-english-to-declaration-drafter]) with a third, authoring-time
  refusal: an English statement a drafter could not map to any known
  evidence-rule kind at all -- distinct from the two above, which are
  compile-time refusals of a claim the compiler UNDERSTOOD but cannot
  decompose. This one fires before there is a claim shape to reason about.
- ``RE_DERIVABILITY_GRADES`` -- design §2.3: whether a constraint's inputs
  are sealed and its verdict independently re-derivable from a compiled
  plan alone (``pure_replay`` -- e.g. containment), or whether re-deriving
  it means possessing the ledger and adopting this repo's own fold
  semantics over ledger state no capsule carries (``ledger_state_dependent``
  -- e.g. caps). Labelled rather than hidden: "an asymmetry named is an
  honesty feature; an asymmetry discovered is an embarrassment."

**The reserved-verdict-word deny-list.** Per licensing law and design §3.6:
publisher vocabulary may name things; only the verifier states verdicts.
Seven words are reserved outright (they assert soundness properties this
format does not make): *verified, certified, compliant, guaranteed, pass,
approved, tamper-proof*. On top of that fixed list, ``check_display_string`` also refuses any
display string that contains the raw enum token it is describing
(case-insensitively) -- e.g. ``MODEL-ASSISTED``'s own rendering may not
contain the substring "model-assisted". That second rule is what "the
mappability labels" (build plan Phase 1 item 6) cashes out to
structurally: self-referential, so it covers the verdict-pair and
refusal/grade jargon without a second, driftable list to keep in sync.
It does not apply to ``response_class`` -- ``accepted``/``declined``/
``deferred``/``no_response`` are already plain English, and restating one
is not the "developer vocabulary leaking onto the auditor's desk" failure
this rule exists to catch.
