"""Scope census (T2): *"this pack covers N of the M outcomes/obligations in
document D."* Design §3.1/§4/§4b gap 3 -- ruled mandatory, not subject to
the doc-3 admission test at all, because it is the entire regulatory
question for obligations and the auditor's first question for outcomes.
Without it, a producer who submits 40 of 60 clauses gets a clean report on
40 and the compiler cannot see the 20 it was never shown.

Two objects, deliberately not one. ``packs/schema.py``'s ``ScopeCensus`` is
the pack-declared CLAIM (what a ``pack.yaml`` states). This module seals
the recorded ACT -- the T2 human sign-off on that claim, at a point in
time -- as a capsule, because "N of M" is worthless as an assertion no one
signed. ``review_by`` carries the census's own expiry: a census with no
freshness turns "is M still M" into an unanswerable question in year two,
exactly as inadmissible as never having had one. Re-census is a new T2
event, never an edit to the old one.
