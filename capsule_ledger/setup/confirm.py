"""``capsule setup confirm`` (design §3.2/§4/§6b): the two touchpoints a
machine cannot make for itself, plus the one that makes a refusal visible
instead of merely present. Every one of these produces a **recorded act,
never a config edit** -- nothing here rewrites a file in place; each call
appends a new, signed capsule to the ledger.

- **T1 -- declaration acceptance.** *"These are the outcomes we are
  claiming, and these are the rules for proving them."* Freezes the
  declaration+mapping pair as a sealed compilation record C
  (``compiler.compile.seal_compilation_record``), citing exactly the
  verdict pair ``propose`` computed (``compile_bridge.compiled_declaration_for``)
  -- never a live recompute against whatever the ledger looks like right
  now. Refuses to accept a candidate whose own verdict pair is REFUSED;
  that path is T4, not T1.
- **T2 -- scope census sign-off.** *"This pack covers N of the M outcomes
  in document D."* Independent of any one outcome_id -- it is a claim
  about the whole document, so it takes its own document digest/N/M
  directly (``compiler.scope_census.build_scope_census_capsule``).
- **T4 -- refusal acknowledgment.** A human must see and accept a REFUSED
  verdict before the refusal is real -- design §4: "without this the
  refusal is invisible and the operator concludes the feature is missing
  rather than that the claim was unprovable." Seals the refusal capsule
  itself (design §2.2's compiler-refusal vocabulary) AND a second capsule
  recording the human's acknowledgment, chained to it.
