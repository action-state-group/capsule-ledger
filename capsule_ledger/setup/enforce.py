"""``capsule setup enforce`` (design §3.5/§4/§6b): promotion, per check,
never bulk, always shadow-first. Only an accepted (T1) candidate whose
forward verdict is ``DETERMINISTIC`` has anything to enforce -- everything
else in this compiler's vocabulary is forward-unavailable or refused by
construction (design §2.2: the judge is never in the enforcement path), so
this module only ever governs attainment-kind outcomes.

**Containment is promotable ahead of the caps work** (design §2.3): a plan
is checked with ``guards/checks/plan_containment.py``'s
``check_plan_containment``, a pure function of ``(action, plan)`` with no
ledger read, so shadow replay and live dispatch here never touch the caps
lock at all -- this module never imports ``guards/engine.py``.

**Every forward refusal ships its reproduction command** (design §6b): the
plan a live dispatch checked against is never persisted -- it is recompiled
fresh from the accepted candidate every time (``compile_bridge``), so
``reproduce_refusal`` (backing ``capsule verify --refusal``) replays the
identical check from sealed inputs and can only ever agree or flag drift,
never merely re-assert.
