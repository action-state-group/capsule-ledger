"""A local, on-disk store of candidate declarations (``candidates.Candidate``
-- design §2.1's ``D``), keyed by ``outcome_id``. This is what makes every
other setup verb's re-derivability claim actually checkable by a caller who
did not run ``propose`` themselves.

Re-derivability (design §2.3/§2.4) comes from possessing D and recompiling,
never from possessing P. This store is exactly that possession, made
durable across CLI invocations: ``propose`` writes a candidate here as soon
as it drafts it (together with the verdict pair it computed, so
``confirm --accept`` freezes exactly what was proposed rather than
recomputing against a possibly-different corpus snapshot), ``confirm``
flips ``acceptance_state``, ``enforce`` reads an accepted attainment
candidate back to re-derive a fresh ``PlanDefinition`` to check against,
and ``capsule verify --refusal`` reads it to replay a forward refusal from
sealed inputs. Deliberately NOT the ledger -- the digest this store's
bytes produce is what gets sealed onto ledger capsules; this is the
durable copy of the bytes that digest commits to, the same relationship a
git object store has to a commit cited from it.
