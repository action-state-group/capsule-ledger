"""``capsule setup propose`` (design §3.4/§6b): the compiler run backwards
from observed traces. Grades ``candidates.DEFAULT_CANDIDATES`` (or a
caller-supplied catalog) against the emit-layer corpus ``observe`` wrote,
and drafts one ``ProposedOutcome`` per candidate that has ANY evidence in
this corpus -- coverage always as **N of M, never a bare percentage**
(design §3.4), WITH-INSTRUMENTATION items always name the missing
instrument, and refusals render exactly as prominently as successes.

**``propose`` writes a file, not a terminal scroll** (design §3.2): the
terminal render here is the preview; ``proposals.yaml``
(``write_proposals_yaml``) is the diffable, committable, reviewable
artifact ``confirm`` actually acts on.

**The drift check** (design §3.2's terraform analogy, acceptance line):
re-running ``propose`` and diffing its candidates against what
``declarations.DeclarationStore`` has on record for the SAME outcome_ids is
the whole mechanism -- ``diff_against_stored`` below, not a second, bespoke
diff tool.
