"""Seals one tau2-bench airline simulation's full conversation (assistant/
user message text + flattened tool-call trail, from
``scripts/vendor_tau2_airline_conversations.py``) as a
``conversation_exchange`` capsule -- the same shape
``capsule-emit-mesh``'s ``mesh_record_emitter.py`` uses for its inference
capsules (``capsule_ledger.conversation.build_conversation_exchange_capsule``).

[tau2-engagement-conversation-detail-capsules]: proves ONE capsule shape
spans mesh inference, tau2, and (once wired) the real Alchemy/Amplifier
Security engagements. Model identity is supplied by the caller rather than
guessed from the sim record -- a real engagement transcript's own metadata
(not a filename convention) is where that identity actually lives, and
keeping the capsule-building side agnostic to WHERE model identity came
from is what lets it generalize to Alchemy/Amplifier Security without
change. ``TAU2_MODEL_ID``/``TAU2_PROVIDER`` below are just this module's own
default for the one dataset it vendors
(``vendor_tau2_airline_conversations.py``: ``claude-3-7-sonnet``).

tau2-bench's transcripts never carry a reasoning field or full tool-call
arguments (``vendor_tau2_airline_conversations.py``'s own docstring: tool
calls are flattened to name only) -- ``tau2_sim_to_exchange_messages``
carries over only what the source actually has, which is exactly what
leaves ``reasoning_digest`` absent from the sealed capsule (see
``digest_conversation_exchange``) rather than a fabricated digest over
nothing.
