"""Named-reason errors for pack definitions (mirrors ``folds/errors.py`` /
``guards/wickets/errors.py`` / ``policy/errors.py``).

A dev's AI coding tool is the primary author of ``pack.yaml`` files (starter-
packs plan: "AI-coded by design"), so every message here follows the same
rule that made those three modules' errors actionable: name the field, say
what was expected, show a correct example inline. A reason code alone is
for tests and tooling; the message is for whoever (human or model) has to
fix the file.
