"""The counterparty-change value-props (standard-outcome-pack design §5) as a
TWO-LAYER composition, not a sixth judgment mode of their own:

  layer 1 (signal)     one per-session outcome this pack already has reason
                        to produce -- structural (a count over emitted
                        fields, no model) or judged (an LLM already scored
                        it against a digest-pinned prompt, sealed BEFORE this
                        module ever runs).
  layer 2 (trajectory)  a design §10 type-2 ``counterparty_change`` fold
                        (``folds/taxonomy.py``, PR #92) over that signal's
                        sealed per-session values, min-N gated,
                        correlation-not-cause framed.

This module only ever touches layer 2. It reduces over already-sealed
per-session signal capsules (dicts with the signal's own numeric field) --
it has no scorer, no prompt, no model call anywhere in it, which is §10.1's
"folds CONSUME judgment capsules and NEVER call the judge harness" invariant
applied to this family specifically. This module deliberately does not
import ``capsule_ledger.judge`` at all: not "avoids calling it today", but
structurally cannot call it (``test_counterparty_signal_folds.py`` asserts
both the static absence of that import and, dynamically, that running a
judged signal's trajectory through this module never touches
``JudgeHarness``/``Scorer``).

Each signal here ``feeds_outcome_id``s one of the pack's own ``C*``
fold_counterparty rows (standard-vendor pack.yaml family E) -- this module
does not re-declare those rows or their tier/statement, it only wires the
fold that would make one of them measured instead of WITH-INSTRUMENTATION.
