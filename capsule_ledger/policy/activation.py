"""Activation is a capsule: adopting or changing the policy manifest appends
a signed, passive event record (``guards/capsule.py``'s ``build_event_capsule``
-- the same mechanism this codebase already uses for degradation/recovery
events, per that module's own docstring) citing the manifest's own digest.

The activation capsule's ``chain.relation`` is ``epoch_opens`` -- the same
chain vocabulary ``cli/blame_cmd.py`` and ``cli/diff_cmd.py`` already know
about (``agent_action_capsule.history``'s registry: a legal chain-start,
never a gap). Each activation chains to the *previous* activation capsule
(if any), so the ledger carries a walkable history of policy epochs; the
very first activation in a ledger cites ``GENESIS_PARENT``, a sentinel
64-hex value that is deliberately never a real capsule_id (mirrors
``tests/test_cli_blame.py``'s own use of an out-of-scope parent for an
``epoch_opens`` boundary -- the point of this relation is exactly that its
parent need not resolve).
