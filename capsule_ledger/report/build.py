"""Assemble a ``DryRunReport`` from a real ``replay()`` run.

Nothing in this module drafts the model-tuning note itself -- ``model_note``
is only ever the operator's own pre-written text (e.g. pasted in from a
separate LLM call they ran themselves), passed straight through, or omitted
(``None``). Every other field is computed from the real ``GuardDecision``
objects ``replay.py`` produced; there is no synthetic fallback.
