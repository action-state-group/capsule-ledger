"""``conversation_exchange``: one capsule per exchange (a tau2-bench
simulation, a live engagement's turn window, a mesh inference request/
response), carrying the SAME ``model_attestation.compute_attestation``
shape ``mesh_record_emitter.py``'s inference capsules carry --
``agent_input_digest``/``agent_output_digest`` over the exchange's own
turns, model provenance (``model_id``/``provider``, plus ``quant``/
``hardware`` when the caller has them), and the labeled sub-digests
``reasoning_digest``/``tool_calls_digest`` (CPB ``mesh-inference-exchange``
registry entry #70, ``scitt-payload-binding``'s
``spec/cpb-provisional-registry.md``).

[tau2-engagement-conversation-detail-capsules]: ONE capsule shape spans
mesh inference, tau2, and (once wired) the real Alchemy/Amplifier Security
engagements. The labeled sub-digests are what make tier-2 fold-scoped
disclosure possible: a holder can later disclose just the tool-call bytes
(``payload_store.PayloadStore``) without disclosing the prompt or reasoning
content, because each is committed under its own label rather than folded
into one opaque digest. Raw message content NEVER enters this capsule --
only digests; disclosure is always a separate, deliberate act.

``reasoning_digest``/``tool_calls_digest`` are OPTIONAL and simply absent
when the source conversation carries nothing under that label -- tau2-
bench's transcripts have no reasoning field at all, which is exactly the
"tau2-bench drops a field" case this shape must tolerate without a
fabricated digest over an empty placeholder. A real engagement transcript
that DOES carry full reasoning/tool-call detail sets both without any
change to this builder.
