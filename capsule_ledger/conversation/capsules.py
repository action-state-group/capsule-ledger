"""Builders for the conversation-capsule profile's two record types:
``conversation_turn`` (one per turn, sealed at turn time) and
``conversation_session_close`` (one per session, binding every turn's
digest into a single session digest).

Both are passive ``fyi`` records -- built via ``guards.capsule``'s
``build_event_capsule``, the same mechanism this codebase already uses for
degradation/recovery events and policy-manifest activations
(``policy/activation.py``) -- so a conversation capsule is an ordinary,
independently verifiable ledger record with no special-cased verification
path, same as every other capsule this codebase produces.

Record-type identity lives in ``asg_payload.event`` (never a repurposed
spec-defined field, matching the workspace's extension-field rule) --
``EVENT_CONVERSATION_TURN`` / ``EVENT_SESSION_CLOSE`` below, discovered via
``find_session_turns`` / ``find_session_close``, the same linear-scan-plus-
filter shape ``policy/activation.py``'s ``find_latest_activation`` uses.
