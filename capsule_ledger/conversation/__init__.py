"""The interim conversation-capsule profile (pre-VAC).

Per-turn ``fyi`` capsules sealed AT TURN
TIME (speaker role, turn-content digest -- never the content itself),
chained turn-to-turn so there is no unsigned window between a turn
happening and the ledger holding a signed record of it, plus one
session-close capsule binding every turn's digest into a single session
digest (Merkle-style, via ``capsule_emit.checkpoint`` -- the neutral CLL/MMR
core capsule-ledger consumes rather than forks) for selective disclosure at
TURN granularity.

This is the interim, ledger-native shape -- it migrates to Verifiable
Agent Conversations (Birkholz et al., COSE_Sign1 session records) once that
cross-party coordination lands; the no-unsigned-window property this module
establishes is itself a candidate contribution back to that draft, which
today has no equivalent guarantee.

Per-speaker judgment targeting (B3, the judge harness) reads
``speaker_role`` off these turn capsules -- ``SPEAKER_ROLES`` is the
complete, closed vocabulary a judge may target.

Public surface:
- ``build_turn_capsule`` / ``build_session_close_capsule`` -- pure capsule
  builders (no ledger I/O), same layering as ``guards.capsule``.
- ``build_turn_reference_capsule`` -- a typed cross-reference from a turn to
  capsule(s) it gave rise to (e.g. a caller's own tool-call capsules),
  resolved back via ``find_turn_reference``.
- ``find_session_turns`` / ``find_session_close`` / ``find_turn_reference``
  -- read a session (or a cross-reference) back off any ``LedgerAPI``.
- ``session_root`` / ``turn_inclusion_proof`` / ``verify_turn_inclusion`` --
  the Merkle session-digest primitives (``.merkle``).
- ``ConversationSession`` -- the stateful recorder: seals and appends each
  turn immediately, then ``close()``s the session.
