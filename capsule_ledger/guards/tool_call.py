"""The tool-call lane (C3, ``[ldg-plan-containment]``): reads emit passive
``fyi`` records; writes route through ``GuardEngine.check()``, which already
IS the enforcement point -- a departure fails the ``plan_containment``
constraint, ``GuardEngine`` denies, and the resulting decision capsule (with
``disposition.decision == "reject"``, ``verdict_class == "blocked"`` --
``guards/capsule.py``) is the refusal capsule. No new gate is built here;
this module only gives tool-call reads the same "record what happened, never
gate it" shape ``build_event_capsule`` already gives every other passive
observation (a conversation turn, a confirm-ingester poll), so a read and a
write are each recorded through the one mechanism suited to what they are.

Observe vs. enforce is a CALLER decision, not something this module decides:
``GuardEngine.check()`` always evaluates every constraint and always records
its verdict, regardless of ``dry_run`` (which only affects the ledger
append's own durability flag -- ``guards/engine.py``). What makes a write
"observed" rather than "enforced" is whether the caller goes on to actually
dispatch the underlying action when ``decision.outcome != "allow"`` -- e.g.
``examples/plan_containment_demo/demo.py``'s Run B never calls (simulates)
``export_user_list`` once containment denies it. ``capsule guard enforce``
(``cli/guard_cmds.py``) is the existing, separate marker for "this
integration has moved from observe to enforce" -- this module doesn't
duplicate it.
